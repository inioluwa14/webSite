        <p><span id="para"> A </span>cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno-English: bun; Australian English: 
        fairy cake or patty cake) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper 
        or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied
        </p>

        <p>A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. 
        Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for 
        cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate 
        chips. Because their small size is more efficient for heat conduction, cupcakes bake much faster than a normal
        layered cake. During baking, the volume of the batter initially increases due to the production of 
        carbondioxide, then decreases upon cooling due to the release of leavening gases.</p>

        <p>Cupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for
        special occasions. They may be filled with frosting, fruit, or pastry cream. For bakers making a small number of
        filled cupcakes, this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole in the top of the 
        cupcake. Another method is to just insert the pastry bag in the middle of the cupcake. In commercial bakeries, 
        the filling may be injected using a syringe.</p>
        <p>Originally, cupcakes were baked in heavy pottery cups. Some bakers still use individual ramekins, 
        small coffee mugs, large tea cups, or other small ovenproof pottery-type dishes for baking cupcakes. 
        Cupcakes are usually baked in muffin tins. These pans are most often made from metal, with or without a non-stick
        surface, and generally have six or twelve depressions or "cups". They may also be made from stoneware, silicone
        rubber, or other materials. A standard size cup is 3 inches (76 mm) in diameter and holds about 4 ounces (110 g)
        although pans for both miniature and jumbo size cupcakes exist. Specialty pans may offer many different sizes
        and shapes. Individual patty cases, or cupcake liners, may be used in baking. These are typically round sheets of
        thin paper pressed into a round, fluted cup shape. Liners can facilitate the easy removal of the cupcake from the
        tin after baking, keep the cupcake more moist, and reduce the effort needed to clean the pan. The use of liners
        is also considered a more sanitary option when cupcakes are being passed from hand to hand. Like cupcake pans,
        several sizes of paper liners are available, from miniature to jumbo. In addition to paper, cupcake liners may be
        made from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on
        their own, foil and silicone liners can also be used on a flat baking sheet, which makes them popular among
        people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out
        of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently 
        for baking without a cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate 
        the strength of a single foil cup.</p>

        <p>In the early 21st century, a trend for cupcake shops, which are specialized bakeries that sell little or 
        nothing except cupcakes, developed in the United States, playing off of the sense of nostalgia evoked by the 
        cakes. In New York City, cupcake shops like Magnolia Bakery gained publicity in their appearances on popular 
        television shows like HBO's Sex and the City. Crumbs Bake Shop, a publicly traded business running the largest 
        cupcake shop chain in the U.S., reached its peak stock price in 2011. Declining sales, due to competition from 
        locally owned mom-and-pop specialty stores as well as increased competition from grocery stores, caused a sharp 
        decline in the company's prospects and stock price in 2013. Georgetown Cupcake was the first cupcakery to open in 
        Washington, D.C. The cupcake shop gained widespread publicity after the 2010 premier of TLC's DC Cupcakes, a 
        six-part reality show about the shop and its owners, sisters Sophie LaMontagne and Katherine Kallinis. Based in 
        Beverly Hills, California, Sprinkles Cupcakes is owned by Candace Nelson, who is also a star judge on the Food 
        Network's Cupcake Wars, and her husband, Charles Nelson. Sprinkles is the first cupcake shop to debut a 
        cupcake ATM, which could hold up to 350 cupcakes at one time.</p>
        <p>These easy cupcakes are so versatile and can be decorated in a variety of different ways, for example, 
        topped with a sweet buttercream icing or cream cheese frosting. Spread the icing with a palette knife on top 
        of your cooled cupcakes or make a piping bag, and pipe swirls onto your cupcakes instead. Find out everything you 
        need to know about how to ice cupcakes with our handy guide including how to create rose and ice cream style 
        swirls.</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s easy to turn these basic cupcakes into chocolate cupcakes, zingy lemon cupcakes or even rich coffee 
        cupcakes; just follow the method above and add drops of your chosen extract to add flavour to each cupcake. For 
        example, try a few drops of vanilla extract for a sweet vanilla flavour or swap the milk in this recipe for orang
        or lemon juice for citrusy cupcakes. If you want to make chocolate cupcakes just swap 1-2oz of flour for cocoa 
        powder instead. To make sure your cupcakes bake evenly, use an ice cream scoop to fill the cupcake cases with the 
        mixture. This will make sure you have an even amount of mixture in each case and that they should rise to the same 
        height. It's also best to make these cupcakes in a bun tray so the cupcake cases can be held in place when 
        baking.</p>
